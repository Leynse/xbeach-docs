How to make a PDF version of the online XBeach manual

v1.0 Leijnse Oct-18

%% 0. Software
a) Make a local clone of the Github repository using TortoiseGIT (https://github.com/openearth/xbeach-docs)
b) Install Anaconda 
c) Make a new environment 'XBeach_docs' in the Anaconda navigator, Python 3.7 seems to work

%% 1. Installing packages
a) Open the Anaconda prompt
b) Open environment by typing: activate XBeach_docs
c) Update pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
d) Install Sphinx: pip install Sphinx
e) pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex
f) pip install git+git://github.com/openearth/sphinxcontrib-partable#egg=sphinxcontrib_partable
g) pip install git+git://github.com/openearth/sphinx-fortran-extension#egg=sphinxfortran
h) pip install breathe
i) pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

%% 2. Making latex files
a) cd to location where the GIThub clone is made, e.g.: cd c:\Users\leijnse\Documents\XBeach_docs\xbeach-docs\docs\
b) change the references from index to index_pdf in the conf.py file to use the index_pdf.rst file
b) type: make latex
c) when error regarding packages occur; try installing them again. 
	When asked for sphinx.ext.pngmath and installing doesnot work; removing this line from the conf.py file under extensions
d) If all went well the folder '_build/latex' is now created, cd to folder: cd _build/latex
e) Make pdf: pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode XBeach
	run 3 times to fix all references
f) If then this doesnt work; try making the pdf using a seperate editor (e.g. Miktex + Texstudio)

Occuring problems: (if rendering stops at some point something has gone wrong, even if no error message is given. Then use a lates-editor like Texstudio to investigate possible errors)
- for some reason adding a blank figure with width 0px when making a figure with subplots doesn't work (appears in tex-file as width=0)- then pdf won't render properly --> changing 0px to 1px works
- double defined lables in one figure/equation/etc is not allowed
- Special characters or words within quotes '' is not allowed


%% 3. Via Readthedocs

a) a pdf can alternatively be made automatically via Readthedocs, but often the XBeach manual is too big to render on this

%% 4. Troubleshoot

Most likely the above will result in latex errors. The most common are:

* Everything after a certain image caption is ignored (images 15, 18, 19 and 22)
  * Solution: remove the \phantomsection\label{...} direction from the image caption
* Rendering of tabulary directive fails
  * Solution: remove white lines in "\textsf{\relax ... }" directive
* Table of contents is too short:
  * Solution: add "\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}" above "\tableofcontents" directive
* Long tables are rendered to a width greater than the page width
   * Solution: change the cell definition to:
     \begin{longtable}{|p{0.2\textwidth}
                       |p{0.4\textwidth}
                       |p{0.2\textwidth}
                       |p{0.1\textwidth}
                       |p{0.1\textwidth}|}
* Long tables are rendered to a length greater than the page height
  * Change the environment from "tabulary" to "longtable"
* Remove author
